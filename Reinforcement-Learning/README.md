# Reinforcement-Learning
This repo contains my code during learning reinforcement learning

Code in this repo might be affected by many difference sources that I used during learning, and they will be added here periodically.

1- Pseudo codes shown in David Silver's UCL course on Reinforcement Learning:

2- These 8 tutorials by Arthut Juliani easily explain the intuition behing a lot of RL concepts:

3- These lectures maintained by Sung Kim from HKUST can fill a lot of gaps:

4- Deep Mind's paper "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning":
